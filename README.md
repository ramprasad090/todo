## Usage

1. **Initialize Notifications**

    Initialize notifications in the main entry point of your app:

    ```dart
    void main() async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await NotificationService().initNotifications();
      runApp(MyApp());
    }
    ```

2. **Schedule a Notification**

    Use the `scheduleNotification` method to set up notifications:

    ```dart
    await NotificationService().scheduleNotification(
      id,
      'Task Reminder',
      'This is a reminder for your task.',
      DateTime.now().add(Duration(minutes: 10)),
    );
    ```

3. **Search Tasks**

    Search tasks by title, description, or date:

    ```dart
    taskController.searchTasks('your query');
    ```

4. **Custom Reminders**

    Use the custom reminder icon to set reminders and handle notifications:

    ```dart
    IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
      onPressed: () {
        // Open reminder dialog and handle scheduling
      },
    );
    ```
